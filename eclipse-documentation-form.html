        <p>A solar eclipse happens when the Moon moves between Earth and the Sun, blocking the Sun's view from a small part of Earth, either completely or partially. This event takes place roughly every six months during the new moon phase, when the Moon's orbit aligns closely with Earth's. In a total eclipse, the Sun is completely covered by the Moon, while in partial and annular eclipses, only a portion of the Sun is obscured. Unlike a lunar eclipse, which can be seen from anywhere on Earth's night side, a solar eclipse is only visible from a limited area. Although total solar eclipses occur on Earth approximately every 18 months, they can only be seen from a specific location once every 360 to 410 years.</p>

        <header>History</header>
        <p>The earliest known solar eclipse is documented on a clay tablet from Ugarit, Syria, with two possible dates: May 3, 1375 BC, or March 5, 1223 BC, with the latter being more commonly accepted by modern scholars. A significant solar eclipse on June 15, 763 BC, mentioned in Assyrian texts, is crucial for understanding the ancient Near East's timeline. There have been claims for earlier eclipses, including a legend about the Chinese king Zhong Kang executing two astronomers for failing to predict an eclipse 4,000 years ago. The earliest unverified claim is by archaeologist Bruce Masse, who associates an eclipse on May 10, 2807 BC, with a potential meteor impact in the Indian Ocean, based on ancient flood myths.
        </p>
        <p> Solar eclipses have been seen as omens or signs. Herodotus recounts how Thales of Miletus predicted an eclipse during a battle between the Medes and Lydians, leading to a ceasefire. The specific eclipse is uncertain, but one likely occurred on May 28, 585 BC, near the Halys River in Asia Minor. Herodotus also mentions an eclipse before Xerxes' expedition against Greece in 480 BC, which aligns with an annular eclipse observed at Sardis on February 17, 478 BC, or a partial eclipse visible from Persia on October 2, 480 BC.</p>
        <p>    In ancient China, eclipses were referred to as "eating of the Sun" (rìshí 日食), with records dating back to around 720 BC. The 4th-century BC astronomer Shi Shen described predicting eclipses based on the Moon and Sun's positions. Efforts to determine the exact date of Good Friday by suggesting it was a solar eclipse have not been conclusive, as Good Friday is associated with Passover, a full moon, and the darkness lasted longer than any solar eclipse's totality.</p>
        <p>A solar eclipse occurred on January 27, 632, during Muhammad's life, which he attributed to natural causes rather than his son's death. The Cairo astronomer Ibn Yunus highlighted the importance of eclipse calculations in Islamic law for determining prayer times. The first recorded observation of the Sun's corona was in Constantinople in AD 968.</p>
        <p>The first telescopic observation of a total solar eclipse was made in France in 1706, followed by Edmund Halley's accurate prediction and observation of a solar eclipse on May 3, 1715. By the mid-19th century, scientific advancements allowed for the identification of the Sun's corona during solar eclipses, with the first photograph of a total eclipse taken on July 28, 1851. Spectroscope observations of the solar eclipse of August 18, 1868, contributed to understanding the Sun's chemical composition.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Total Eclipse
            <p>A total eclipse happens roughly every 18 months, during which the Moon's dark silhouette completely covers the Sun, revealing the Sun's faint corona. This event is visible only along a specific path on Earth, known as the path of totality. </p>
          </li>
          <li>Annular Eclipse
            <p>Annular eclipse occurs when the Sun and Moon align with Earth, but the Moon is too small to completely block the Sun, resulting in the Sun appearing as a bright ring around the Moon. Annular eclipses happen once every one or two years, not annually, and are named after the Latin word for "ring." </p>
          </li>
          <li>Hybrid Eclipse
            <p>A hybrid eclipse, which can be either total or annular depending on the observer's location, is relatively rare. </p>
          </li>
          <li>Partial Eclipse
            <p>Partial eclipses occur about twice a year, when the Sun and Moon are not perfectly aligned with Earth, and the Moon only partially covers the Sun. These eclipses are visible from a large part of Earth outside the track of an annular or total eclipse, but their impact on the Sun's brightness is minimal, making them barely noticeable.</p>

        <header>Duration, Frequency, and Future Events</header>
        <p>The duration of a total eclipse is limited to a maximum of about 7 minutes and 32 seconds due to the Moon's umbra moving at over 1,700 km/h. This duration is gradually decreasing over time, with the longest possible total eclipse in the 8th millennium expected to last less than 7 minutes and 2 seconds. The last eclipse longer than 7 minutes occurred on June 30, 1973, and the next one exceeding this duration will not happen until June 25, 2150. The longest total solar eclipse in the 11,000-year period from 3000 BC to at least 8000 AD will be on July 16, 2186, lasting 7 minutes and 29 seconds. In comparison, the longest total eclipse of the 20th century lasted 7 minutes and 8 seconds, and there will be no total solar eclipses longer than 7 minutes in the 21st century.</p>
        <p>Eclipse cycles, such as the saros, allow for the prediction of future eclipses. A saros cycle lasts 6,585.3 days, or about 18 years and 11 days, meaning that after this period, a nearly identical eclipse will occur. The most significant difference will be a westward shift of about 120° in longitude and a slight shift in latitude. A saros series typically starts with a partial eclipse near one of Earth's polar regions, moves across the globe through a series of annular or total eclipses, and ends with a partial eclipse at the opposite polar region. A saros series can last between 1226 to 1550 years and include 69 to 87 eclipses, with about 40 to 60 of them being central eclipses.</p>
        <p>Annually, between two and five solar eclipses take place, with at least one eclipse occurring during each eclipse season. Since the introduction of the Gregorian calendar in 1582, the years with five solar eclipses were 1693, 1758, 1805, 1823, 1870, and 1935. The next year with five solar eclipses is predicted to be 2206. On average, there are approximately 240 solar eclipses in each century.</p>
